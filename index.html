                <p>This is the homepage for the Reclaim Chicago Fair Elections Task Force. You can read about us and the Fair Elections Ordinance
                    <a href="">here</a>.</p>
                <p>This is also where we post reports on Chicago's aldermen. These are not meant to be balanced summaries on the aldermen but expose how money affects the decisions that aldermen make, nominally on behalf of our city, but often more for the benefit of their large donors. You can access them by clicking Wards above, by searching an alderman's name in the search in the navbar, or find your own alderman by typing your address into the search bar below:</p>
