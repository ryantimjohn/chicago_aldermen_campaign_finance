description: I'm a web designer/photographer with an organizing background who has lived in Chicago for all of my 31 years. Honestly, I'm a part of this project because there's not a lot I can do to correct what's happening in Washington at the moment, but I know I can have a real impact on politics in my hometown. It's easier to make change than people think.
