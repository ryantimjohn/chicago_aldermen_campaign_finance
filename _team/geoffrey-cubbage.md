description:  I believe that broken systems generate broken results, and it's hard to imagine a political system more broken than Chicago's. Prior to my work on the Fair Elections taskforce, I was a projects analyst for various development initiatives in Afghanistan, and I try to bring some of that research background to bear on the complex web of campaign contributions, City Council votes, patronage jobs, and contracting that we call "the machine."
