description: I'm a musician originally from Cincinnati. Ever since moving to Chicago for school, I've been struck by the discrepancy between Chicago's progressive people and history and Chicago's corrupt and backwards politicians. After fair elections ordinances have passed in U.S. cities, new local governments have come to power that sound and look like their constituents. When we pass the FEO, Chicagoans will be empowered to elect a city council and mayor reflect their values.
