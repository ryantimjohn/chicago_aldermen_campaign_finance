description: I think that a few big donors deciding the outcome of elections is incompatible with democracy. That these donors must buy politicians because their needs are in opposition to the needs of the people in the community. I am passionate about passing a fair elections ordinance because I believe it's implementation in Chicago is necessary (but not sufficient) to pass other legislation for meaningful economic, racial, environmental, and gender justice. Outside of the task force I study neural signals that reflect how memory changes over time. Basically, in both organizing and science, I am interested in a) how events that happen now influence a system in the long run and b) how change can be adaptive.
