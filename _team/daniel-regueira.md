description: I'm a community organizer, currently with Reclaim Chicago and formerly on Daniel Biss’ campaign for Governor. I want leaders at all levels of government who make decisions based on economic, racial and gender justice. I’m invested in transforming campaigns to be about community, not about flooding the airwaves when you wanna kick back and watch TV. The Fair Elections Ordinance moves us towards that. In my free-time, you can catch me bowling or at karaoke
