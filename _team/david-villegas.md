description: I am currently a student at Roosevelt University and also a part of the Chicago Student Action Network. I've been active in marches and rallies demanding the upper class pay their fair share towards the rest of the population. I was raised in a working class family living in areas long neglected by government resources. I understand why people feel like their voice doesn't matter. I try my best to motivate everyone to speak up for their right to live peacefully. Yet I never gets discouraged since I always believe in hope for the future. I remain active within organizing spaces because I feel violence is never the answer to achieve something. I live in the Chicago suburb of Oak Lawn with a hope of moving back to within the city of Chicago.
